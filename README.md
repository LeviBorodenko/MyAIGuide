# OptimizeUs

This open-source project aims to explore the relationships between symptoms, daily activities and external factors in the context of mild to severe chronic conditions. <br/>
If correlations are found, this will open up the way to the creation of AI-based recommendation systems to help patients better manage their conditions. For instance, this recommendation system could encourage or discourage patients from performing some activities or exposing themselves to some external factors in real time in order to optimize the management of their disease.<br/>
At this point, we only have one folder (called “OM”) corresponding to one project, but feel free to add more projects or to contribute to that one.
