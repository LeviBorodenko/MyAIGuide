# OptimizeUs

The ultimate aim of this open-source project is to gain a better understanding of chronic pain and to help people suffering 
from this medical issue. To achieve that aim, we are collecting health data from people experiencing long lasting mild to severe pain 
problems. We will use all of the data gathered to investigate how different ways of resting affect the evolution of 
symptoms (the value of resting is underlined <a href=https://www.painscience.com/articles/art-of-rest.php target="_blank">here</a>
). We will also investigate the effect of other factors. 
In the long term, we hope to use the knowledge gained to create recommendations systems based on Artificial 
Intelligence to help past and present chronic pain sufferers better manage their daily lives, in other words: 
to optimize us!<br/>
If you are suffering from lower extremity chronic pain (knee, foot, ankle, ect..) 
and want to contribute to OptimizeUs, please read this: 
<a href='http://robinhood.scientizen.com/lowerextremitytrack' target='_blank'>Lower extremity track</a>.
If you have another kind of chronic pain, you can consider tracking it the hard way:
<a href='HowToTrackHealthData.md' target='_blank'>hard core self-tracking</a>.<br/>
This project is open-source: anybody can contribute to the analysis of the data and our creation and its benefits 
belong to everyone. The data is also open-source by default. If you want to donate data but you don't want it to be
 made open-source for privacy reasons, you can upload your data to
 <a href='http://robinhood.scientizen.com/' target='_blank'>Scientizen</a>.<br/>
This project is hosted here on Github, here's a project we've already done: 
<a href='OM/README.md' target='_blank'>First Experiment</a>. <br/>
In the future, we also hope to tackle other medical conditions.<br/>
