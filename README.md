# OptimizeUs

This repository is for people who want to publicly share their health data and/or the analysis of their data; and for people who want to analyze the health data of other individuals.<br/>
The aim is to collect big longitudinal health data directly from people without intermediaries and to let anyone contribute to the analysis of the data. This project represents one steps towards allowing all of us to explore the relationships between symptoms, daily activities, biological variables and our external environment in order to better understand diseases. <br/>
Given the nature of the data collected, a future application of this repository could be the creation of AI-based recommendation systems to help patients better manage their conditions, in other words: to Optimize Us!<br/>
At this point, we only have one folder (called "OM") corresponding to one sub-project, but feel free to add more sub-projects or to contribute to that one.
