# OptimizeUs

The ultimate aim of this open-source project is to gain a better understanding of chronic pain and to help people suffering 
from this medical issue. To achieve that aim, we are collecting health data from people experiencing long lasting mild to severe pain 
problems. In the long term, we hope to create recommendations systems based on Artificial Intelligence to help past
and present chronic pain sufferers better manage their daily lives, in other words: to optimize us!<br/>
If you are suffering from long lasting pain problems and want to contribute to OptimizeUs, please read this:

This project is open-source: anybody can contribute to the analysis of the data and our creation and its benefits 
belong to everyone. The data is also open-source by default. If you want to donate data but you don't want it to 
be made open-source for privacy reasons, this isn't a problem at all, we understand that not everyone is comfortable 
publicly sharing sensitive information. In that case, you can either send us an email or upload your data to <a href='http://robinhood.scientizen.com/' target='_blank'>Scientizen</a><br/>
This project is hosted here on Github, here's a project we've already done: 
<a href='OM/README.md' target='_blank'>First Experiment</a>. <br/>
In the future, we also hope to tackle other medical conditions.<br/>
