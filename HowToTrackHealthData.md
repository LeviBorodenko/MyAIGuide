# How to track health data

<H2 CLASS="western">Indispensable tracking:</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western">1) Fitness Tracker:</H3>
<P><SPAN LANG="en-US">Use a fitness tracker to track the amount of
physical activity you do everyday. To avoid uncomfortable skin
rashes, we recommend taking off the the tracker while you're not
moving: for example, when sitting for long periods of time or when
sleeping. It's important to choose a tracker that allows to export
'per minute' data. Although not through a very straightforward way,
<A HREF="https://www.fitbit.com/home" TARGET="_blank">Fitbit</A> does
allow to do this and is probably the best tracker to use nowadays
despite its slight inaccuracies. One way to alleviate these
innacuracies is to wear the tracker on the ankle instead of the
wrist.</SPAN></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">2) Computer Tracker:</H3>
<P><SPAN LANG="en-US">For people making extensive use of computers,
we recommend using software programs to track how much you use your
computer. The best option we've found so far is to use both <A HREF="https://www.manictime.com/download/" TARGET="_blank">ManicTime</A>
and <A HREF="https://whatpulse.org/" TARGET="_blank">WhatPulse</A> at
the same time. ManicTime is entirely free and WhatPulse is really
cheap. </SPAN>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">3) Logging Activities:</H3>
<P><SPAN LANG="en-US">Next, you'll need to log the activities you do
throughout the day. For that, use <A HREF="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waterbear.taglog&amp;hl=en" TARGET="_blank">Taplog</A>.
Create a folder for each type of activity you think might be related
to your pain problems. For most people, it should be sufficient to
track physical activities. In that scenario, create a folder called
'sport', and for each type of sport you do, create a button to press
when you start the activity and a button to press when you stop doing
that activity. For example, if you go swimming, create a button
'swimming str' and a button 'swimming end'. It's very important that
each activity you do follows the template 'activity str' / 'activity
end' (the two buttons must have the same name inside it and must just
differ by how they end: ' str' for the first button and ' end' for
the second one. If you don't want to create a separate button for
each sport you do, you can also just create two buttons 'sport str'
and 'sport end' (see part 6). </SPAN>

<H3 CLASS="western">4) Logging average pain intensity each day:</H3>
<P>Two options here: 
<br/>
1-Create an Excel or Open Office spreadsheet
that you will fill in every evening. This spreadsheet should look
like this: </br>
![Alt text](images/painSpreadsheetExample.png?raw=truoe
&quot;Per Day&quot;) 
</br>
2-Use taplog: create a folder called Pain and
create buttons inside it for each painful body region. Add the
possibility to add a quantity to these buttons. Every evening, press
the appropriate buttons and log your pain intensity in that area
through the quantity menu. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Optional tracking:</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western">5) Daily Information:</H3>
<P>Create an Excel or Open Office spreadsheet (similar to the pain
one in the previous section), and create columns for anything you
thing might be relevant. You can also have a 'free text input' column
in which you can simply write about your day. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">6) Physical activity details:</H3>
<P>If you've created a 'sport str' and a 'sport end' buttons in
taplog (see section 3), then you can also create a spreadsheet where you
can add details about the activity you did. It should look like this:</br>
![Alt text](images/general.png?raw=truoe &quot;Per Day&quot;) 
</br>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">7) GPS:</H3>
<P><SPAN LANG="en-US">For logging GPS positions with your smartphone
(for instance during physical activities), you can use an app called
<A HREF="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendhak.gpslogger&amp;hl=en" TARGET="_blank">GPS
Logger</A>. Preferably, change the settings so that the gps position
is logged only every 45 seconds (to avoid draining the battery). </SPAN>
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Saving and Sharing Data:</H2>
<P>The data recorded through ManicTime, WhatPulse and taplog needs to
be exported to your computer. The data from WhatPulse needs to be
exported every 7 days (the 'per day' is what's needed). For
ManicTime, you should export both 'app' and 'time'. Preferably, you
should backup your data in case your computer crashes, for example
with Google Drive. If you want to share your data with us, please
